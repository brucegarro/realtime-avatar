| 3 Workers + TensorRT | ~74s | **146 videos/hour** | **6.3x** 🚀🚀 |

### Recommendation

**Deploy with 2 workers** for optimal balance:
- 2.0x throughput improvement (4.2x with TensorRT)
- 42% GPU utilization (plenty of headroom)
- Simple architecture
- Easy to scale to 3 workers if needed

### Implementation

```python
from workers.concurrent_generator import ConcurrentVideoGenerator, VideoJob

# Create generator with 2 workers
generator = ConcurrentVideoGenerator(
    num_workers=2,
    voice_sample_path="/path/to/voice.wav"
)

# Initialize (loads models once)
generator.initialize()
generator.start()

# Submit jobs
job = VideoJob(
    job_id="video_001",
    image_path="/path/to/portrait.jpg",
    text="Hello, this is a test.",
    output_path="/path/to/output.mp4"
)
generator.submit_job(job)

# Get result
result = generator.get_result("video_001")
```

---

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Enable GPU Acceleration

**Local (M3 Mac):**
```bash
# Start GPU service with MPS
cd runtime && ./run_gpu_service.sh

# 5-10x speedup for TTS
```

**GCP (L4 GPU):**
```bash
# Use TensorRT-optimized Ditto
AVATAR_BACKEND=ditto-trt

# 2.5x speedup for video generation
```

### 2. Adjust Diffusion Steps

Trade quality for speed:

```python
# config.py
DITTO_DIFFUSION_STEPS = 25  # Default: 50 (balanced)
# Lower = faster, higher = better quality

# Options:
# 10 steps: 4x faster, good quality
# 25 steps: 2x faster, excellent quality ✅ RECOMMENDED
# 50 steps: baseline, best quality
```

### 3. Resolution Tuning

```python
# config.py
VIDEO_RESOLUTION = (384, 579)  # 3:4 portrait
# Lower resolution = faster generation

# Options:
# 256x384: 4x faster, lower quality
# 384x579: 2x faster, good quality ✅ RECOMMENDED
# 512x768: baseline, best quality
```

### 4. Concurrent Workers

```python
# For high throughput on GCP L4
CONCURRENT_WORKERS = 2  # 2x throughput

# Scale to 3 workers if needed (3x throughput)
```

### 5. Model Caching

```python
# Reduce first-request latency
# Keep GPU service running between requests
# Models stay loaded in VRAM
```

### 6. Batch Processing

```python
# For multiple videos
# Submit jobs to concurrent generator
# Process multiple videos in parallel
# 2-3x throughput improvement
```
